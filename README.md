This is a project which combines what I've learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript from The Odin
Project so far. It also serves as a refresher for my knowledege on data analysis with R.

The data was obtained from Singapore's data.gov website. In this project, I analysed data of the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) of goods and services in Singapore, focusing mainly on the essentials.

Note: I'm not exactly certain of the accuracy of my observations of the graphs produced from the
data, so any feedback is welcome!
